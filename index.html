<h2> CASESTUDY:MISLEADING VISUALIZATION ON GLOBAL WARMING </h2>

On Dec. 15 2015, National Review published a tweet with a line chart named "average annual global temperature in Fahrenheit",
which was criticized as "the bad chart heard around the (graphics) world".

 <p>
In this line chart, National Review want to show the change of average annual global temperature from 1880 to 2015. 
  The y-axis represents temperature starting from zero. In general, temperature in these 135 years keeps rising and the change was within five degrees. 
  A change of even one degree in the average global temperature is significant, but starting this chart at zero makes it look miniscule.
  What we can see from this chart is a smooth line, which gave the misleading information of slow growth.
 </p>

<p>
If we want to accurately represent the change in the global average temperature since 1880, 
 we should start the y-axis at a higher number. 
 In this case, the significant rise of five degrees can be showed clearly.

 According to  <a href="https://qz.com/418083/its-ok-not-to-start-your-y-axis-at-zero/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> 
  , many people complain about their charts because` the y-axis doesn’t start at zero. 
  From their point of views, truncating the y-axis, as we often do in line charts, exaggerates what the data really represent.
  Some people consider it a maxim that the y-axis should always be zeroed. 
  Otherwise, they think it is lying with data visualization.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Nevertheless, It’s OK not to start the y-axis at zero for better storytelling.
Charts should convey information and make a point. 
We make charts to illustrate ideas that have context beyond their x- and y-axes. 
Forcing the y-axis to start at zero can do just as much to obscure and confuse the point as the opposite.

 <p>
   <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/11/19/9758062/y-axis-zero-chart" target="_blank">“Shut up about the y-axis. It shouldn’t always start at zero,”</a> 
reads a vox.com headline. Sometimes, you have to start the y-axis somewhere other than zero to show appropriate context such as the global warming case.
